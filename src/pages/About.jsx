          I am a 𝑹𝒆𝒄𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝑴𝒂𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒓’𝒔 𝑮𝒓𝒂𝒅𝒖𝒂𝒕𝒆 𝒊𝒏 𝑫𝒂𝒕𝒂 𝑺𝒄𝒊𝒆𝒏𝒄𝒆 & 𝑨𝒑𝒑𝒍𝒊𝒄𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒔 (𝑮𝑷𝑨 3.9) at the 𝑼𝒏𝒊𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒔𝒊𝒕𝒚 𝒂𝒕 𝑩𝒖𝒇𝒇𝒂𝒍𝒐 (𝑫𝒆𝒄 2025) with 2.5+ 𝒚𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒔 𝒂𝒕 𝑻𝒂𝒕𝒂 𝑪𝒐𝒏𝒔𝒖𝒍𝒕𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒚 𝑺𝒆𝒓𝒗𝒊𝒄𝒆𝒔 (𝑻𝑪𝑺) as a 𝑫𝒂𝒕𝒂 𝑨𝒏𝒂𝒍𝒚𝒔𝒕, 𝑩𝒊𝒈 𝑫𝒂𝒕𝒂 𝑷𝒚𝒕𝒉𝒐𝒏 𝑫𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒍𝒐𝒑𝒆𝒓, 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑨𝑰 𝑫𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒍𝒐𝒑𝒆𝒓, along with a client-facing capstone engagement with 𝑴𝒆𝒅𝒊𝒂𝑺𝒂𝒍𝒆𝒔 𝑷𝒍𝒖𝒔.

My expertise lies in 𝒅𝒂𝒕𝒂 𝒆𝒏𝒈𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒆𝒓𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑴𝑳 𝒔𝒚𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒎𝒔 - building 𝒔𝒄𝒂𝒍𝒂𝒃𝒍𝒆 𝒑𝒊𝒑𝒆𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒔, 𝒓𝒆𝒍𝒊𝒂𝒃𝒍𝒆 𝑬𝑻𝑳/𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒎𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒌𝒇𝒍𝒐𝒘𝒔, 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒑𝒓𝒐𝒅𝒖𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏-𝒈𝒓𝒂𝒅𝒆 𝒅𝒆𝒑𝒍𝒐𝒚𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒔 across distributed platforms and applied analytics.

At 𝑻𝒂𝒕𝒂 𝑪𝒐𝒏𝒔𝒖𝒍𝒕𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒚 𝑺𝒆𝒓𝒗𝒊𝒄𝒆𝒔 (𝑻𝑪𝑺), I:
🔹 Designed and deployed end-to-end ML pipelines using PySpark, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, improving deployment efficiency by 28% and increasing classification accuracy by 15%.
🔹 Optimized distributed workflows with Cloudera, Kafka, HDFS, and Kudu, reducing query latency by 40% and improving data reliability.
🔹 Managed and tuned distributed jobs (Spark/Flink) in production environments to improve processing performance and stability.
🔹 Supported production-grade deployments with Kubernetes, ensuring 99.9% uptime with robust debugging and model evaluation practices.

At 𝑼𝒏𝒊𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒔𝒊𝒕𝒚 𝒂𝒕 𝑩𝒖𝒇𝒇𝒂𝒍𝒐, I strengthened expertise in:
🔹 Data Engineering / ML Infrastructure - deployment, evaluation, optimization, debugging, pipeline reliability.
🔹 Statistical Data Mining & Applied ML - modeling, feature engineering, and evaluation using real-world datasets.
🔹 Projects including Spark streaming pipelines (checkpoint recovery), graph algorithms (Dijkstra in PySpark), and graph analytics with Neo4j.

At 𝑴𝒆𝒅𝒊𝒂𝑺𝒂𝒍𝒆𝒔 𝑷𝒍𝒖𝒔 (CDA 500 Capstone), I:
🔹 Built an end-to-end analytics pipeline to automate recurring reporting from monthly CSV/Excel datasets across business units.
🔹 Implemented data standardization + quality validation checks and delivered a Streamlit KPI dashboard with trend/anomaly views and forecasting summaries.

💡 𝑺𝒆𝒆𝒌𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒇𝒖𝒍𝒍-𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒆 𝒓𝒐𝒍𝒆𝒔 (𝑱𝒂𝒏 2026) in Data Science / Data Engineering / Analytics Engineering / Machine Learning Engineering | Available immediately | F-1 OPT (STEM) - open to roles where I can build reliable pipelines and scalable ML systems in production.
